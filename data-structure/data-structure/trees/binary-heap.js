// Binary heap is a type of binary tree. It is a complete binary tree.
// In a MaxBinaryHeap parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. Each parent has at most two child nodes.
// The value of each parent node is always greater than its child nodes.
// In a max Binary Heap the parent is greater than the children, but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes.
// A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first.
// In a MinBinaryHeap parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes
// The value of each child node is greater than its parent nodes. But there are no guarantees between sibling nodes.
// Binary Heaps are used to implement Priority Queues, which are very commonly used data structures.
// They are also used quite a bit, with graph traversal algorithms.
// Priority Queue is a data structure where each element has a priority. Elements with higher priorities are served before elements with lower priorities.
